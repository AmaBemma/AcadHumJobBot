# AcadHumJobBot
A TwitterBot that retweets TT academic jobs and PostDocs in the humanities. 


WHY DID I BUILD THIS?
  1) I've been playing around with Python and I wanted something hands on to test the basics of what I've been learning. 
  2) I'm a PhD student on/going on the job market. I follow a number of academics who tweet about job openings in their department. I want to be aware of these Tweets without being on/ surfing through Twitter 24/7. Hence, we now have this bot.
  3) I needed an excuse to use  GitHub more often.
  4) I know it will be useful.
  
WHAT JOBS DOES THE BOT RETWEET?
  TT and PostDoc positions in the humanities, specifically African American lit, African Lit, Africana Lit, World Lit, Global Anglophone Lit, Poetry and Poetics, Digital Humanities, and Media Studies.
